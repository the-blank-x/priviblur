Priviblur is a proxy. It makes requests to Tumblr in lieu of you allowing you browse without being tracked. 

It has no account requirement either. Allowing you to view your favorite blogs without ever needing to login.

It is lightweight and works without Javascript. Allowing for a much faster experience compared with Tumblr.

It has a modern design. Although perhaps not quite there yet, the project aims to replicate the experience seen on modern software.

It is licensed under the AGPLv3 ensuring that itself and all instances are free and open. Forever.
